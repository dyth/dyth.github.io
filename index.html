		<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		<p>My research goal is to create software enabling anybody to train any robot on any task.  The most challenging obstacle towards this goal is informing the robot what task to do.  This could be alleviated by robots that understand language.</p>
		<p><b>Long Term</b>: the Wozniak test; natural-language instruction-following; grounded language learning </p>
		<p><b>Short-Medium Term</b>: adaptive agents; model-free RL; meta-learned optimisers; energy-based models; targeted exploration</p>
