				<p>Hello and welcome to my personal homepage! I am currently a second year student reading Computer Science at Trinity College, Cambridge. After matriculating in 2015, I pursued a first-year course with Physics and Mathematics. My focus of study is Artificial Intelligence by Machine Learning, a broad and diverse field which manifests itself in the realms of Data Science, Computation Theory, Computer Vision, Artificial Life and Deep Learning.</p>

				<p>During the summer of 2017, I was a Data Science intern at Facebook. During the twelve week placement, I analysed the effect of advertisments on user behaviour, producing metrics on advertiser quality from raw user data. This enabling better prioritisation in Audience Network, an Ad Network platform. The role was ideal to learn about industry practices, especially skills acquired outside the lecture theatre.</p>
				
				<p>During my second year, I won a Science Essay Prize for my essay championing reductionist architectures for AI. Additionally, I participated in a group project sponsored by ARM to program a centralised swarm of robots to analyse and extract information about a square floor pattern. During the Easter Term, I assisted with the practical aspect of Interaction Design, a first year course. My role as a demonstrator encompassed the assistance and assessment of first year undergraduates in creating an assessible user interface through short viva voce and help sessions.</p>
				
				<p>In the summer of 2016, I interned at the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. My role a summer Undergraduate Research Opportunities Student (UROP) enabled me to collaborate with Boeing Defense UK and experience life as a researcher. I worked on a human-in-the-loop project enabling users to simulatenously interact with multiple videos using computer vision via a web app.</p>
				<p>Before university, I competed in regional, national and international competitions in robotics, music and mathematics. When I am not coding, I can be found in a practice room, experimenting with artistic or popular music or trying out a new noodle bar. If the above fails, I will either be writing literature, drawing, swimming, cycling, or doing something football-related!</p>

					<h1>Projects</h1>
					<p>A side-effect of being naturally curious is that I enjoy learning, analysing and discovering everything that catches my interest in great detail! The three things that are most likely to do this usually have some intersection with AI by Machine Learning, Physics and various genres of music -- the more experimental, the better! The list below is a subset of my total projects since October 2016 (the inaguration of this website).</p>

					<h2>Artificial Intelligence by Machine Learning </h2>
					<p>Artificial Intelligence is a mysterious topic which has entranced me from an early age. Having enjoyed using physical and mathematical techniques to model the world around me, I found it difficult to apply the same set of equations to the concept of intelligence, though it is easy to intuitively grok. Recent advances in deep learning and increased funding of related startups has only increased my desire to pursue a career in this field.</p>
					<p> <a href="https://github.com/dyth/Computer-Vision-Experiments">Computer Vision</a> is a key component of an agent's ability to perceived the environment. Another useful input is <a href="https://github.com/dyth/NLPExperiments">Natural Language Processing</a>. Using inferred data, it is possible to exploit hard-coded rules of the environment to decide the next action to take using a 1960s technique called Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence, or <a href="https://github.com/dyth/GOFAI">GOFAI</a>. As hard coding every rule is difficult and time-consuming, <a href="https://github.com/dyth/Machine-Learning-Experiments">Machine Learning</a> techniques are used. Currently, the algorithms that achieve the highest success rates are <a href="https://github.com/dyth/Deep-Learning-Experiments">Deep Learning</a> based. However, recent advances such as AlphaGo combine both Deep Learning and Knowledge Engineering to <a href="https://github.com/dyth/GOFAIApproximations">approximate GOFAI.</a> </p>
					<p> A tangential idea to create agents is that of <a href="https://github.com/dyth/causalEntropicForces">Causal Entropic Forces.</a> An agent would simulate as many paths as possible to take in the future, before choosing the one that would generate the greatest number of future states.</p>
					
					
					<p>All of my thoughts about AI are in <a href="#writings">one place</a> -- enabling me to quickly scan all the information or remind me of a forgotten idea.</p>
					
					<h2>Physics and Applied Mathematics </h2>
					<p> Applied mathematics, or Theoretical Physics, is a wonderful discipline enabling a user to model and predict the universe. For me, expressing the world in numbers would lead to a better understanding of the universe we live in, enabling decisions to be made with greater confidence.
					</p>
					<p>Relating Bayes' Theorem to a perceptron <a href="#writings">(Notes on AI, Section 3.3)</a></p>
					<p>Derivation of Backpropagation <a href="#writings">(Notes on AI, Section 3.6)</a></p>
					<p>Derivation of a Support Vector Machine <a href="#writings">(Notes on AI, Section 4)</a></p>

					<h2>Programming</h2>
					<p>Programming is (like) magic (and, indeed, it should be taught that way), as it enables a user to manipulate concepts and ideas through a theoretical framework of invocations and representations. Hypotheses and simulations can be created without mess (or fuss), and physically impossible situations can be constructed. With the nascent online community increasingly being interconnected and suffused with data and information, programs empower their users in whichever way they desire, within a digital era where everybody is equal. Less sentimentally, it's always fun to test to destruction!</p>
					<p>At the heart of any segment of code is a Turing Machine, an arbitrary mathematical construct which enables computability to be represented. A slightly less abstract version is a <a href="https://github.com/dyth/ComputationTheory">Register Machine</a>. Simple Turing Machines which resemble primitive life-forms are <a href="https://github.com/dyth/1dCellularAutomata">One Dimensional Cellular Automata</a>. Two Dimensional Cellular Automata are more complex, and include the famous Game of Life. Increasingly complicated Turing Machines can simulate programs representing <a href="https://github.com/dyth/Artificial-Life-Experiments">Artificial Lifeforms</a>. Beyond that, algorithms can be invented for anthropic and biological  <a href="https://github.com/dyth/Simulations">simulations.</a></p>

						<h1>Writings</h1>
						<p>Monographs are a wonderful unstructured way of expressing my thoughts about a topic. In the following selections of my work, I have tried to be as unbiased as possible (unless I am expressing an opinion), and they will be continually updated throughout the year depending on whether I remember and the abundance of free time.</p>
						
						<p> More of my works can be found on <a href="https://medium.com/@dyth">Medium</a>

						<h2><a href="./3.PublicNotebook.pdf" download>Collected notes on Artificial Intelligence</a></h2>
						<p>A collection of thoughts about creating Artificial Intelligence by Machine Learning. The document includes a introduction to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GOFAI and some personal philosophical musings.</p>
						
						<h2><a href="./AIReductionismHolism.pdf" download>Descartes and Spinoza in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</a></h2>
						<p>An essay I wrote during my second-year studies which won a Trinity College Science Essay Prize. In the essay, I discus the meaning of AI and the ways in which it could be created using a historical-philosophical context. Then I introduce the holism versus reductionism dichotomy, and, using this new context, explore the efficiency and safety of the various techniques and why I believe reductionism is becoming increasingly relevant.</p>
