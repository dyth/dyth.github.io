				Aspiring AI researcher. Two favourite subtopics are Deep Reinforcement Learning and Computational Learning Theory. I believe the marriage of these topics to diverse contexts can empower and emancipate communities, perhaps uncovering facets of our own intelligence through the joy of discovery and development.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also an admirer of aesthetics, I am an aspiring writer, working on my first novel. In addition, I have a diploma in Piano Performance from ABRSM and a Grade VIII Distinction in Violin. Music, literature and computer programming are languages of varying complexity, ideal for conveying ideas, emotions and beauty.
